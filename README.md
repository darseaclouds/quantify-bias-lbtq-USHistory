# Quantifying Bias against LGBTQ+ peoples through 20th and 21st century United States 

## Abstract
This paper uses a combination of natural language processing, a subfield of artificial intelligence/computer science, and traditional corpus linguistic techniques to explore how the language surrounding LGBTQ evolves through 20th and 21st century United States. I also provide historical and legal context to investigate if significant shifts in language surrounding LGBTQ people align with relevant historical events. The main analysis involves tracing the semantic shift of the word “gay” through the Corpus of Historical American English overtime. Using the methods k-nearest neighbors, collocation, stereotype quantification from word embeddings, and concordance, I found that the language surround the word “gay” has significant shifts in the years 1960 and 1990. These two years correspond with significant events in the gay rights movement and AIDS epidemic. Discussion is supplemented with analysis of other words relating to the LGBTQ community (“homosexual,” “lesbian,” and “queer”) using similar methods.
